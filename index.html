<!-- was almost better because About | Portfolio | Contact were in one line - but centered and one line below the <h1 Kylie </>. When I changed it and enveloped the <a> withing <li> within <ul>, adjusted id nav to float right and display inline, the 3 words moved to correct line but stacked on top of each other and the list dots appeared.-->

			<p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'  Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour & the like).</p>
